# Deleting Secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager using the AWS CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command, replacing with the ARN or name of the secret you want to delete: 
```
aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id
```
You can specify a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days, and the default recovery window is 30 days.

If you want to force deletion without recovery, you can use the ```--force-delete-without-recovery``` flag.

Secrets Manager will attach a DeletionDate stamp to the secret, specifying the end of the recovery window. At the end of this window, the secret will be permanently deleted.

**Note:** You cannot directly delete a version of a secret; instead, you remove all staging labels from the version to mark it as deprecated. Secrets Manager will then automatically delete the version in the background.
Remember to adjust the command with your specific secret ID and preferences. And as always, be cautious when handling sensitive information! ü§ê

**Example:**
Assuming you have a key of arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-norteast-1:195486278901:secret:mysecret-3kR5wR the command would be:
```
aws secretsmanager delete-secret ‚Äìsecret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-norteast-1:195486278901:secret:mysecret-3kR5wR
```

If needed you can set your region using ```‚Äìregion [REGION]`` to specify a region different from your AWS config file ```~/.aws/config```.

For more details, you can refer to the official [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/delete-secret.html)
